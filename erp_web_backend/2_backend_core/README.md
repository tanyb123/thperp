# Backend Core (NestJS)

Planned technology: NestJS + TypeScript, deploy to Google Cloud Run.

Modules (planned):
- auth: Validate Firebase JWT, map roles
- inventory: CRUD materials/products
- production: BOM + Work Orders
- quoting: Pricing calculator (POST /calculate) -> publish to Pub/Sub

Environment variables:
- DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASS
- PUBSUB_TOPIC_NAME

This placeholder exists to keep directory structure until NestJS scaffold is added.
